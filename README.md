The difference between wasm and js
js is an interpreted language. It does not compile before the code runs, but compiles it in real time during execution. In order to enable smooth execution while compiling, we have a js engine.

Wasm is different. It is not a programming language, but a bytecode standard. Different kinds of high-level programming languages, such as Rust, Go, Python, etc., can be used to convert the code into The .wasm file is put into the wasm virtual machine pre-made in the browser to run
